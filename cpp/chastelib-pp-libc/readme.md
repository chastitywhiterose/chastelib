# chastelib C++ Edition Libc

This version of chastelib contains the same functions as the C version. However, it has been tested with the g++ compiler to make sure it works. Sometimes there are differences between the C or C++ as far as compilers go. These functions can be used therefore with either language.

As long as you `#include <stdio.h>`, then everything should work the same as it does in C.
